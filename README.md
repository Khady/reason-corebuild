# reason-corebuild

[`corebuild`][corebuild] is a script provided by `core` from JaneStreet. It
is notably used to build the [examples][rwo-examples] of the [Real World OCaml][rwo]
book.

[`reason-corebuild`](reason-corebuild) is the equivalent script but to build
code written using the [Reason][reason] syntax. It replaces the usage of
`ocamlbuild` by `rebuild`.
